# Mii Brawler Tips & Tricks
---
## Overview

1. Brawler is a rushdown character. Strike fast, hard, and K.O. faster than you lose your own stocks.
2. Even though brawler has some crazy combos, don't forget to control neutral and win those little fights. Every amount of % counts. 
3. Always go for a stage with platforms. That could be PS2, Small Battlefield or even basic Battlefield. Just make sure you've got on-stage platforms to work with.
